Cancers of the colon, rectum and prostate are among the primary causes of cancer mortality. It is estimated that pancreatic cancer accounts for 7% of total cancer deaths. The average lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer is 1 in 64.

While most acute pelvic pain is caused by reproductive, urinary or gastrointestinal tract diseases, musculoskeletal, vascular and neurologic abnormalities can also play a role in this. Because the causes and therapy of pelvic pain in pregnant women vary greatly, excluding pregnancy is a vital step. Pregnant women are referred for prompt assessment. Pelvic discomfort is usually associated with stomach pain and can be a difficult problem to treat due to the need to assess a wide range of probable illnesses.",
    "Why should you go for a Women’s Imaging Second Opinion?_p2":"A broad definition of low abdominal or pelvic pain that has been present for less than three months is considered to be acute pelvic pain, a nonspecific symptom. The pain can be localized or diffused and it occasionally includes musculoskeletal and low back discomfort. The pain may be intermittent or persistent, localized or widespread, severe or dull. The most frequent cause is pelvic pathology, which includes illness of the gynaecologic, digestive and urologic systems. A patient may experience abdominal and pelvic pain at the same time or pain that originates in one area and spreads to another. It's important to note that a patient with chronic pelvic pain may arrive with an acute condition that develops suddenly or a pain exacerbation.",

If they burst, ovarian cysts and ectopic pregnancies can cause uncontrollable intraperitoneal bleeding. To maintain ovarian function, ovarian torsion must be rapidly detected and treated. Acute sepsis and long-term infertility can both be caused by PID and its severe form, TOA. Although it is rare, a non-pregnant woman's uterus can also rupture.",

Owing to population increase and aging, the worldwide burden of cancer is anticipated to rise to 27.5 million new cases and 16.3 million cancer deaths by 2040. The future cost is also likely to be greater due to the rising frequency of risk factors in economically transitional nations such as smoking, unhealthy food, physical inactivity, etc.",

These include invasive diagnostic procedures such as an arteriogram test or a biopsy as well as endovascular and percutaneous therapies. It is impossible to include all of the interventional radiology techniques here.",
    "What is Interventional Radiology?_p2":"Cancer therapies have advanced significantly in recent years and it is now feasible to provide curative treatments for some tumours either by embolization or through thermal ablation, which entails utilising heat from high-frequency radio waves or microwaves to kill cancer cells.",
    "Treatment":"Treatment",
    "Treatment_p":"Here are some of the therapies for which IR is deemed helpful, ranging from oncology to surgery:",
    "Stopping the bleeding":"Stopping the bleeding",
    "Stopping the bleeding_p":"IR helps patients halt bleeding by closing bleeding arteries from the inside with fewer consequences. It also treats haemorrhages, which is very crucial after surgery. There is no need to conduct another operation on the patient to halt the bleeding.",
    "Tumour pathologies":"Tumour pathologies",
    "Tumour pathologies_p1":"IR employs percutaneous procedures to access tumours via probes using medical imaging:",
    "Tumour pathologies_p2":"CT scans, MRI, and ultrasound. The goal is to find the tumour and implant probes into it in order to eliminate it. Heat radiated by radio frequencies or microwaves is employed for this purpose. As a result, the tumour is internally burnt.",
    "Tumour pathologies_p3":"Probes that freeze tissues at -80 °C can also be utilised as an alternative. The liquid freezes inside the cells, causing them to explode. Tumors are thus eradicated in this manner without requiring a surgery or an incision on the patient. This is as successful as surgery in properly chosen circumstances.",
    "Tumour pathologies_p4":"On rare occasions, IR also provides complete cures for tumours that were previously thought to be incurable. For instance, a cancer of any kind can be injected with radioactive particles to irradiate it from the inside before it is ultimately destroyed. This procedure, called radioembolisation, is well tolerated by patients.",
    "Tumour pathologies_p5":"Injecting customised viruses that will exclusively assault tumour cells is another very promising method. Naturally, the virus is altered to prevent it from harming healthy cells.",
    "Bile ducts and gallstones":"Bile ducts and gallstones",
    "Bile ducts and gallstones_p1":"Additionally, biliary diseases, gallstones and bile duct blockages are treated with IR. Gallstones can be broken up and removed without surgery by entering the bile ducts to unclog them in the same manner as vessels are.",
    "Bile ducts and gallstones_p2":"Also, when it comes to your Interventional Radiology procedure, you should always consider a second opinion. A second opinion confirms the present diagnosis and choice of procedure or it provides new information that may improve therapy success. When the diagnosis is ambiguous or there is no expected therapeutic response or you are unhappy with the diagnosis or therapy, you should seek a second opinion.",
