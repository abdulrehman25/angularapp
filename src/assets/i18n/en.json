So it is extremely important to be vigilant if anything unusual is felt in the abdomen as pain or discomfort in the area can signal many serious health concerns.",
    "Why do you need a second opinion in abdominal radiology?_p2":"Three of the five most seriously afflicted organs by cancer are located within the human abdomen. Cancers of the colon, rectum and prostate are among the primary causes of cancer mortality. It is estimated that pancreatic cancer accounts for 7% of total cancer deaths. The average lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer is 1 in 64. Misdiagnosis of pancreatic cancer is common because symptoms are typically vague or unclear, such as prolonged pelvic pain or general abdominal discomfort. Given the fast development of pancreatic cancer, this is exceedingly risky.",

    "Why should you go for a Prostate Radiology Second Opinion?_p2":"PSA (prostate-specific antigen) screening is commonly used to determine whether a patient has prostate cancer.

This helps prevent unnecessary over or under-treatment that often contributes to treatment failures.",
    "Why should you go for a Prostate Radiology Second Opinion?_p4":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a more accurate vision of potentially serious prostate malignancies, making it useful for suitable patients who have opted for a biopsy and facilitating direct targeting of lesions during a biopsy.

    "Why should you go for a Prostate Radiology Second Opinion?_p5":"MRI can also prove to be useful for the evaluation of males with established diagnosis of prostate cancer.

While most acute pelvic pain is caused by reproductive, urinary or gastrointestinal tract diseases, musculoskeletal, vascular and neurologic abnormalities can also play a role in this. Because the causes and therapy of pelvic pain in pregnant women vary greatly, excluding pregnancy is a vital step. Pregnant women are referred for prompt assessment. Pelvic discomfort is usually associated with stomach pain and can be a difficult problem to treat due to the need to assess a wide range of probable illnesses.",
    "Why should you go for a Women’s Imaging Second Opinion?_p2":"A broad definition of low abdominal or pelvic pain that has been present for less than three months is considered to be acute pelvic pain, a nonspecific symptom. The pain can be localized or diffused and it occasionally includes musculoskeletal and low back discomfort. The pain may be intermittent or persistent, localized or widespread, severe or dull. The most frequent cause is pelvic pathology, which includes illness of the gynaecologic, digestive and urologic systems. A patient may experience abdominal and pelvic pain at the same time or pain that originates in one area and spreads to another. It's important to note that a patient with chronic pelvic pain may arrive with an acute condition that develops suddenly or a pain exacerbation.",
    "Why should you go for a Women’s Imaging Second Opinion?_p3":"Ectopic pregnancy rupture, ovarian cyst rupture (of any sort), ovarian torsion, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA), and uterine rupture are common gynaecologic diseases (rare in non-pregnant women). If they burst, ovarian cysts and ectopic pregnancies can cause uncontrollable intraperitoneal bleeding. To maintain ovarian function, ovarian torsion must be rapidly detected and treated. Acute sepsis and long-term infertility can both be caused by PID and its severe form, TOA. Although it is rare, a non-pregnant woman's uterus can also rupture.",
    "Why should you go for a Women’s Imaging Second Opinion?_p4":"Further, ovarian and breast cancer risks are getting higher every day.
