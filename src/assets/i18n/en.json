So it is extremely important to be vigilant if anything unusual is felt in the abdomen as pain or discomfort in the area can signal many serious health concerns.",
    "Why do you need a second opinion in abdominal radiology?_p2":"Three of the five most seriously afflicted organs by cancer are located within the human abdomen. Cancers of the colon, rectum and prostate are among the primary causes of cancer mortality. It is estimated that pancreatic cancer accounts for 7% of total cancer deaths. The average lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer is 1 in 64. Misdiagnosis of pancreatic cancer is common because symptoms are typically vague or unclear, such as prolonged pelvic pain or general abdominal discomfort. Given the fast development of pancreatic cancer, this is exceedingly risky.",

    "Why should you go for a Prostate Radiology Second Opinion?_p2":"PSA (prostate-specific antigen) screening is commonly used to determine whether a patient has prostate cancer. The widespread use of this test has decreased cancer-related mortality in men. This comes with greater discovery and treatment of numerous tumors with limited spreading potential (i.e., clinically insignificant lesions).",
    "Why should you go for a Prostate Radiology Second Opinion?_p3":"The presence of clinically significant lesions, the extent of disease diagnosis and determination of risk of future progression should always be prioritized with accurate assessment. This helps prevent unnecessary over or under-treatment that often contributes to treatment failures.",
    "Why should you go for a Prostate Radiology Second Opinion?_p4":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a more accurate vision of potentially serious prostate malignancies, making it useful for suitable patients who have opted for a biopsy and facilitating direct targeting of lesions during a biopsy. MRI may also be used to gauge tumor stage and assess therapy response.",
    "Why should you go for a Prostate Radiology Second Opinion?_p5":"MRI can also prove to be useful for the evaluation of males with established diagnosis of prostate cancer. The benefits include optimizing tumor localization for staging and risk stratification, selecting appropriate candidates with low-risk disease for active surveillance, monitoring during active surveillance and detecting local failure after radiation therapy.",
    "Why should you go for a Prostate Radiology Second Opinion?_p6":"Staging — Prostate MRI can help with staging by confirming organ-confined status (and thus supporting the decision to perform nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy), assessing the status of the pelvic lymph nodes and determining the location and local extent of the tumor in patients who are candidates for radiation therapy.",

    "Why should you go for a Women’s Imaging Second Opinion?_p1":"Non-menstrual pelvic discomfort affects more than one-third of reproductive-aged women at some point in time. While most acute pelvic pain is caused by reproductive, urinary or gastrointestinal tract diseases, musculoskeletal, vascular and neurologic abnormalities can also play a role in this. Because the causes and therapy of pelvic pain in pregnant women vary greatly, excluding pregnancy is a vital step. Pregnant women are referred for prompt assessment. Pelvic discomfort is usually associated with stomach pain and can be a difficult problem to treat due to the need to assess a wide range of probable illnesses.",
    "Why should you go for a Women’s Imaging Second Opinion?_p2":"A broad definition of low abdominal or pelvic pain that has been present for less than three months is considered to be acute pelvic pain, a nonspecific symptom. The pain can be localized or diffused and it occasionally includes musculoskeletal and low back discomfort. The pain may be intermittent or persistent, localized or widespread, severe or dull. The most frequent cause is pelvic pathology, which includes illness of the gynaecologic, digestive and urologic systems. A patient may experience abdominal and pelvic pain at the same time or pain that originates in one area and spreads to another. It's important to note that a patient with chronic pelvic pain may arrive with an acute condition that develops suddenly or a pain exacerbation.",
    "Why should you go for a Women’s Imaging Second Opinion?_p3":"Ectopic pregnancy rupture, ovarian cyst rupture (of any sort), ovarian torsion, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA), and uterine rupture are common gynaecologic diseases (rare in non-pregnant women). If they burst, ovarian cysts and ectopic pregnancies can cause uncontrollable intraperitoneal bleeding. To maintain ovarian function, ovarian torsion must be rapidly detected and treated. Acute sepsis and long-term infertility can both be caused by PID and its severe form, TOA. Although it is rare, a non-pregnant woman's uterus can also rupture.",
    "Why should you go for a Women’s Imaging Second Opinion?_p4":"Further, ovarian and breast cancer risks are getting higher every day.

    "Why do you need an Oncological Radiology Second Opinion?_p1":"Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world. It is estimated that nearly 10 million deaths were caused by cancer in 2020. The most common types of cancer in 2020 (in terms of new cases of cancer) were that of the breast with 2.26 million cases and the lungs with 2.21 million cases. Each year, the numbers increase. Owing to population increase and aging, the worldwide burden of cancer is anticipated to rise to 27.5 million new cases and 16.3 million cancer deaths by 2040. The future cost is also likely to be greater due to the rising frequency of risk factors in economically transitional nations such as smoking, unhealthy food, physical inactivity, etc.",
    "Why do you need an Oncological Radiology Second Opinion?_p2":"Early detection of cancer becomes crucial as the chances of successfully treating the disease considerably increases. The two elements of cancer detection are screening and early diagnosis (or down staging). The process of oncological screening evaluates healthy individuals to find those who may have cancer before any symptoms even occur; early diagnosis focuses on identifying symptomatic patients as soon as possible.",

    "Tumour pathologies_p3":"Probes that freeze tissues at -80 °C can also be utilised as an alternative. The liquid freezes inside the cells, causing them to explode. Tumors are thus eradicated in this manner without requiring a surgery or an incision on the patient. This is as successful as surgery in properly chosen circumstances.",
    "Tumour pathologies_p4":"On rare occasions, IR also provides complete cures for tumours that were previously thought to be incurable. For instance, a cancer of any kind can be injected with radioactive particles to irradiate it from the inside before it is ultimately destroyed. This procedure, called radioembolisation, is well tolerated by patients.",

With the introduction of MRI, multi-detector-row CT (MDCT), PET/CT and the rapidly developing applications for these modalities, the imaging-industry knowledge base has grown substantially. Keeping up with the newest breakthroughs is becoming increasingly difficult for radiologists. Because no one person can be an expert in everything, radiology subspecialists have evolved: first as clinical experts (musculoskeletal, neuroradiology, body radiology and interventional), then as modality experts (MRI, CT, PET and so on) and finally as experts in specialized clinical, modality, anatomy and pathology areas.",
